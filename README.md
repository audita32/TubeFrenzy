# Tube Frenzy:

The game allows users to utilise various types of pipes to establish a connection from the starting point to the endpoint, enabling the seamless flow of water.Developed in C, it is powered by the Intel NIOS II Processor within an FPGA and uses the keys and switches of the DE1 SOC board.

# Game Description:
1)Two end points need to be connected to make the water flow from one end point to another. If you succeed to do that then it shows passed or else shows failed.

2)It uses KEY0 to move from one box to another and the switches are used to control which direction to move.Sw0 is set to (‚¨Ü), Sw1 to (‚¨á)  , Sw2 to (‚¨Ö) , Sw3 to (‚û°Ô∏è ).
Suppose if the user selects sw3 and then clicks on Key0 then it will move to its left box from
the current box position.

3)KEY1, sw4 and sw5 are used to turn the direction of the tubes. Sw4 is set to üîÅ, sw5 to üîÉ, Suppose if the user selects sw4 and clicks on sw4 then it will turn the tube in this direction in 5 lines4)KEY2 is to make the water flow through the pipes that are connected. And if you press KEY2 again it will make the water disappear.

4)KEY3 is used to reset the entire game. And every time you reset you will get those 6 pipes in different positions of the grids.
